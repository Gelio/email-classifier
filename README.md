# Email classifier #

This is a Node.js application that classifies emails to different owners using Naive Bayes algorithm.

Data should be in the *email-data* directory. It's available to be downloaded [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tgz).

This is a mini-project in Udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud120/) first module.
