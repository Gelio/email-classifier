# Email classifier #

This is a Node.js application that classifies emails to different owners using Naive Bayes algorithm.

It's for a mini-project in Udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud120/) first module.


## Set up ##
Data should be in the *email-data* directory. It's available to be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects) (in *tools*, you should copy *email_authors.pkl* and *word_data.pkl*).
